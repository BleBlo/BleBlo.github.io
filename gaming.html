        <h1>Gaming: Where Strategy Meets Creativity</h1>
        
        <h2>My Gaming Journey</h2>
        
        <img src="images/code.jpg" alt="Computer screen showing JavaScript programming code with syntax highlighting" width="600">
        
        <p>Gaming represents more than entertainment for meâ€”it's a platform for <strong>strategic thinking</strong>, <em>community building</em>, and creative problem-solving. My gaming interests span from survival world-building to competitive first-person shooters, and I often combine gaming with programming to create custom modifications and automation tools.</p>

        <h2>Minecraft: Building Survival Worlds</h2>
        
        <p>In Minecraft, I focus on <big>survival mode world-building</big>, where resource management, architectural planning, and long-term strategic thinking converge. Creating sustainable settlements requires the same analytical skills I apply to data science projects.</p>

        <h3>My Minecraft Philosophy</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Establish efficient resource gathering systems early in the game</li>
            <li>Design aesthetically pleasing yet functional base structures</li>
            <li>Implement redstone automation for repetitive tasks</li>
            <li>Balance exploration with consolidation of established territories</li>
            <li>Document building techniques for future reference and improvement</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Battlefield 6: Competitive Gaming</h2>
        
        <p>Battlefield 6 represents the <em>competitive dimension</em> of my gaming interests. The large-scale combat scenarios demand team coordination, situational awareness, and rapid decision-making under pressure.</p>
