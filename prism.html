        <p>During my internship at the <strong>Abu Dhabi Investment Authority</strong> in summer 2024, I spearheaded the development of PRISM, an artificial intelligence-powered tool that fundamentally transformed how investment data is processed across the organization.</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        
        <p>Investment analysts faced a <em>critical bottleneck</em>: manually extracting and analyzing data from over 200 sources took approximately 25.5 hours per quarterly cycle. This time-consuming process limited the speed of decision-making and introduced potential for human error in financial analysis.</p>

        <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
        
        <p>PRISM represents a comprehensive solution integrating multiple advanced technologies to automate complex data analysis workflows.</p>

            <dt>Processing Speed</dt>
            <dd>Reduced 25.5 hours to 2 minutes per document</dd>
            
            <dt>Accuracy Rate</dt>
            <dd>Exceeded 98% accuracy, surpassing manual methods</dd>
            
            <dt>Time Reduction</dt>
            <dd>Achieved 96% reduction in extraction time</dd>
            
            <dt>Department Impact</dt>
            <dd>Successfully deployed across six major departments</dd>
